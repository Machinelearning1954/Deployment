# Machine Learning Project (AWS SageMaker) Todo List

- [x] Analyze project requirements (already done, but keeping for completeness)
- [x] Design data preparation strategy for SageMaker (S3 upload, formatting)
- [x] Implement data acquisition and initial preprocessing (script: `prepare_imdb_data_for_sagemaker.py`)
- [x] Prepare data for SageMaker (script: `prepare_imdb_data_for_sagemaker.py`)
- [ ] Upload processed data to an S3 bucket (User action - instructions provided in scripts)
- [x] Write SageMaker-compatible training script (`train.py`)
- [x] Write SageMaker-compatible inference script (`inference.py`)
- [x] Create script/instructions for configuring and launching SageMaker training job (`launch_sagemaker_training_job.py`)
- [ ] Monitor SageMaker training job progress and retrieve model artifacts (User action initially, then I can help process results)
- [ ] Deploy the trained model to a SageMaker endpoint
- [ ] Test the SageMaker endpoint with sample data
- [ ] Evaluate model performance using metrics from SageMaker training and endpoint testing
- [ ] Optimize model or training process if necessary (e.g., hyperparameter tuning)
- [ ] Create a GitHub repository for the project
- [ ] Add all code (preprocessing, training, inference scripts, SageMaker notebooks if used) to the GitHub repository
- [ ] Add documentation (README.md explaining the project, setup, and how to run/interact) to the GitHub repository
- [ ] Develop a simple user interface or API client to interact with the SageMaker endpoint
- [ ] Document the interface and how to use it
- [ ] Compile final project report/documentation covering all ML lifecycle steps
- [ ] Prepare final deliverables (GitHub link, interface link/instructions)
- [ ] Send complete project deliverables to the user
